The payload used was `{{''.__class__.mro()[1].__subclasses__()[71]('/etc/passwd').read()}}`, which is intended to execute Python code to read the `/etc/passwd` file on the target system. It is possible that the payload was not properly constructed, or that the target system is configured to prevent this type of attack.

The payload, `{{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('id').read()}}`, uses the `os` module to execute the `id` command on the target system and return the output. This finding suggests that the target system may be vulnerable to further exploitation, potentially allowing the commenter to capture the flag.
